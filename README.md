**Ping Pong Game on Raspberry Pi Pico**



Welcome to the Ping Pong Game project! This repository contains the source code and documentation for an arcade-style ping pong game developed using the Raspberry Pi Pico.

Project Overview
This project utilizes the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller to create an interactive ping pong game. The game is displayed on an SSD1306 OLED screen and controlled with a potentiometer, providing an engaging user experience. A passive buzzer is used to generate sound effects, adding an auditory dimension to the gameplay.

Features
OLED Display: Renders game graphics on an SSD1306 OLED screen.
Analog Control: Uses a potentiometer for paddle control.
Sound Effects: Implements a passive buzzer for in-game sounds.
Efficient Communication: Utilizes I2C protocol for communication between the Raspberry Pi Pico and the OLED display.
Smooth Control: Uses PWM for precise control of the potentiometer input and buzzer output.
GPIO Management: Effectively handles GPIO pins for seamless integration of hardware components.
Technical Skills Demonstrated
Embedded Systems Programming: Written in C to ensure efficient and real-time performance.
Hardware Interfacing: Integrated multiple hardware components including an OLED display, potentiometer, and buzzer.
Communication Protocols: Implemented I2C communication for data transfer.
Signal Processing: Managed PWM for analog input and audio output.
GPIO Utilization: Coordinated various GPIO pins for hardware interaction.
